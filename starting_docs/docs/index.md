# The aiida-koopmans plugin for [`AiiDA`](http://www.aiida.net)

Authors: Miki Bonacci (PSI), Julian Geiger (PSI).

This is meant to help the [Koopmans package](https://koopmans-functionals.org/en/latest/index.html) to be used within AiiDA.
For now, nothing is here, as we are mainly working in a [fork](https://github.com/mikibonacci/koopmans) of the Koopmans code.

Every modification done in the Koopmans code by Miki Bonacci is denoted by the comment `#MB mod`.
